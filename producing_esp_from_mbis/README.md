This subdirectory contains scripts to compare quantum mechanical (QM) electrostatic potentials (ESPs) with ESPs reconstructed using the MBIS multipole expansion.

### Files in this subdirectory

- **`comparison.ipynb`**  
  Jupyter notebook for analyzing and comparing MBIS-reconstructed ESPs against QM-derived ESPs.

- **`utility.py`**  
  A collection of utility functions used by `comparison.ipynb` to support the analysis.
