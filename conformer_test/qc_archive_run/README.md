In this subdirectory we build the local qcarchive instance which builds the data from different QM methods and compares
the ESPs generated with the new charge models and AM1BCC. 
The following files are in this subdirectory: 

1. *build_charge_models.py*: add the charge model info to the geometries from the local qcarchive instance. 

2. *explore_parquet.ipynb*
