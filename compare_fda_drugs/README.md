Here we comparse the partiall polarised ML models (interpolated 50% between the gas and water models) 
over a selection of FDA approved drugs available here https://github.com/RPirie96/FDADrugPropAnalysis/blob/main/data/FDA_0022.xlsx. 
The following files are in this folder:

1. *compare_fda_drugs.py*: this script builds the dataset of FDA on-atom charges for comparisons.

2. *explore_parquet.ipynb*: here we analyze the inidividual on-atom charges from these on-atom charges.
