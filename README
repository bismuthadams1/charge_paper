## Charge Paper Code

The subdirectories pertain to the following studies:

* **producing_esp_from_mbis**: a test to see what the errors are when rebuilding the ESPs from the mbis multipole expansion
up to the quadrupole
* **comparison_of_charge_models**: code which tests a number of charge models by comparing partial charges, dipoles and esps. The directory contains scripts to produce the QM ground truth, produce the charge model data, and analyse the data. 
* **benchmarking_new_charge_models**: code for creating test/train/val loss.

* **benchmark_wf_analysis** code

* **compare_fda_drugs**
