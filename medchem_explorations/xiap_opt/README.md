This subdirectory contains a workflow for docking ligand structures into factor Xa (fXa), using the structure provided in `pdb5c7a.pdb`. The file `ligandXIAP.pdb` serves as the starting ligand.

The docking and optimization process is handled in the `Docking.ipynb` notebook, where the starting ligand can be modified and optimized within the protein binding pocket.

Once optimized, the `break_into_multiple.py` script splits the `optimised_molecules.sdf` file into individual ligand structures. These structures are then analyzed using the `plot_partial_charges.ipynb` notebook, which visualizes partial charges generated by the new charge models.

Additional `.sdf` and `.pdb` files included in the directory are intermediate outputs from this workflow.

Experimental binding data and the calculated partial charges are compiled in `MedChem Results - Xiap.csv`.
