Here we dock ligand structures to fXa provided in hte `2vh6.pdb` file. The `in.pdb` file represents the starting ligand.
Within the `Docking.ipynb` notebook we can modify this ligand and then optimize it in the context of the protein pocket.
Then, `break_into_multiple.py` script will break up the `optimised_molecules.sdf` file. We can the plot the partial charges
with the new charge models in the `plot_partial_charges.ipynb`. Other sdf and pdb files provided are intermediates to this process. 
The experimental binding info alongside the calculate partial charges can be found in `MedChem Results - fXa.csv`.
