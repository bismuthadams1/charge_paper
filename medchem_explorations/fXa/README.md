This subdirectory contains a workflow for docking ligand structures into factor Xa (fXa), using the protein structure provided in `2vh6.pdb`. The file `in.pdb` serves as the initial ligand structure.

The `Docking.ipynb` notebook allows you to modify the ligand and optimize it within the context of the fXa binding pocket.

After optimization, the `break_into_multiple.py` script splits the `optimised_molecules.sdf` file into individual ligand structures. These can then be analyzed using the `plot_partial_charges.ipynb` notebook, which visualizes partial charges generated by the new charge models.

Other `.sdf` and `.pdb` files in the directory are intermediate files produced during this workflow.

Experimental binding data, alongside the calculated partial charges, can be found in `MedChem Results - fXa.csv`.
