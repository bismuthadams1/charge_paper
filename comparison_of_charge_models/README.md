### Files in this subdirectory

- **`build_charge_models.py`**  
  Generates a Parquet file containing molecules and conformers with electrostatic properties computed using various charge models.

- **`build_esps.py`**  
  Retrieves 50,000 compounds from QCArchive and reconstructs their electrostatic potentials (ESPs) from wavefunction data.

- **`plot_charge_results.ipynb`**  
  Jupyter notebook to visualize and compare charge distributions from the different charge models.

- **`plot_dipole_and_esp_results.ipynb`**  
  Jupyter notebook to compare dipole moments and ESPs across the charge models.
